# Collections (Queues): Burrows-Wheeler-Transform

In this exercise a Burrows-Wheeler-Transform is implemented via the use of queues to hold the rotations of a given string. A string can be transformed with the forward() method and retrieved with the backward() method.  

The source code is in the `src/` directory, a test can be found in the `test/`directory.
