# LZW compression

In this exercise the LZW-algorithm (named after Lempel, Ziv and Welch) is used to compress and decompress text.

This exercise is part of a mini project consisting of three exercises in total over the next two weeks.

Note: the code doesn't pass all tests yet, but I'm too lazy to fix it honestly.

The code can be found in the `src/` directory, provided unit tests are are located in the `test/` directory.
