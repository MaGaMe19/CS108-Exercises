# Design Pattern: Observer - Spreadsheet

This exercise is about creating a really simple spreadsheet (like excel, calc, etc.) using the Subject-Observer Design Pattern. The source code is in the `src/` directory.  

The project uses [JavaFX](https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/)  

Warning: this exercise is really weird.
