# Collections (Maps): L-Systems and Fractals

In this exercise, L-Systems (or Lindenmayer system) are implemented which are collections of a starting string and rules to modify that starting string. The rules describe how that string needs to be handled when evolving the system. The output of such a system is then drawn as a fractal.  
The source code is in the `src/` directory. The file to run and play around with is `src/cs108/Main.java`.
